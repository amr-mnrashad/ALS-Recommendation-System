# ALS recommendation system
Building a model-based recommendation system through the implementation of ALS recommender
The aim of this project is to be able to generate recommendation to the user based on his/her preferences. There were no explicit rating/score, hence a score had to be calculated first before performing ALS recommender.
More details can be found in the notes of the notebook.
